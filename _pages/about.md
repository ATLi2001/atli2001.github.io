I'm a current first-year Computer Science PhD student at Cornell University where I am advised by [Lorenzo Alvisi](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/lorenzo/). 
I am broadly interested in distributed systems, cloud computing, and the challenges in creating efficient, durable, consistent, and fault tolerant systems. 
I previously completed my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science at Princeton University, where I worked with [Amit Levy](https://www.amitlevy.com/) and [Wyatt Lloyd](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wlloyd/). 
Outside research, I like to play soccer, pickleball, and read. 
You can find a copy of my CV [here](/assets/pdf/AustinLiCV.pdf).
